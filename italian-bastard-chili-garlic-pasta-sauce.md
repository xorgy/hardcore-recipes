# Italian Bastard Chili-Garlic Pasta Sauce 
A rich, calorie-loaded pasta sauce I synthesized from
memories of a favourite Italian restaurant.

## Ingredients
 - 2 medium  onions, yellow or pink, french cut or finely chopped
 - 1 tbsp  butter
 - two Italian style sausages
 - approx. 800ml of tomatoes, preferably San Marzano type, puréed.
 - lots of garlic powder (you could use fresh garlic, but there's no point)
 - lots of chili pepper flakes (with seeds), or paste (with seeds) of chili peppers. 
 - approx. 70g of cheddar cheese
 - a dash of red wine or light vinegar
 - olive oil

## Process

Heat a medium non-stick pan to medium heat.
Add the sausages to the pan whole, with
a small amount of olive oil to fry more evenly.
Once the sausages are somewhat cooked, 
remove them to a cutting board and diagonally cut
them into slices roughly 4-6mm thick.
Put the sausage slices back in the pan, 
and fry them until browned.

Heat a pot to mid-low heat.
Add the butter to the pot and allow it to melt.
Add the the onions.
Sauté gently for 30-40 minutes for optimal flavour, 
or for less time if in a hurry, turning every so
often with a wooden spoon or spatula for even exposure.

Empty the browned sausage slices into the pot.
Put a dash of red wine or light vinegar in the sausage pan 
and release the delicious brown bits with a wooden spoon.
Pour the solution from the sausage pan into the pot.

Add the tomatoes and cheese to the pot.
Add chili pepper and garlic to taste, when in doubt, add more garlic.

Serve over penne rigate, with (crunchy) bread on the side.
